- This paper delves into strategies controlling picker blocking delay of the batch picking in a narrow-aisle order picking system by proposing an integrated batching and sequencing procedure called the indexed batching model (IBM) to minimize the total retrieval time.
- This study develops a mixed integer programming solution for exact control and demonstrates a simulated annealing heuristic procedure to analyze realistic problem sizes.
- The results indicate that IBM unveils significant effectiveness on narrow-aisle picking systems.
