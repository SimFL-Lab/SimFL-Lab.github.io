    <h6>Mission statement</h6>
    <p>The objective of the Simulation & Facility Logistics (SimFL) Laboratory is to develop large-scale simulation models, 
        operational algorithms, machine learning models that will improve the operations and productivity of logistics and related production systems. 
        Active research areas include simulation optimization, material handing and self-organizing operations, 
        and OR applications in warehousing, semiconductor, display, and construction equipment industries.</p>
